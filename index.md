The cooking industry is trying to eat us.  Nobody needs all these appliances.  Nobody needs kitchens this shiny.  The love is gone from gizmo cookery.

Escape!

[Stuff a backpack with cheap, versatile kit.](#kit)  Should cost less than an XBox.  Way less.

[Find a safe place to cook.](#environment)

[Stock essentials](#freebies), or stuff 'em in the bag.

[Limit your cash.](#cash)

[Cook](#challenges).  Feed people.

## <a id=kit>Kit</a>

This is your equipment.  Nothing more, and more than enough.

In general, buy the cheapest one that works.  Try for used, or repair something broken.  When in doubt, commercial, not consumer.  Scrounge.

Stuff it all in a cheap backpack.  The ugliest one you can find.  Respect your tools, but do not love them.

## <a id=cache>Cachet</a>

The more people you can teach to cook your meal reliably, the better.

Points:  Widely available ingredients.  Great technique.  Cheap equipment.  Time management.  Creative misuse of tools.  Sharing online.  Mistakes.  Failed experiments.

No Points:  One-off bargains.  Specialty ingredients.  Relying on particular kit.  French jargon.  Production value.  Flashy nonsense.  Physical danger.  Unsafe eats.
